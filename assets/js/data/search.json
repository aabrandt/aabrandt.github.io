I’m Andreas Aabrandt, an applied scientist and engineer specializing in production AI/ML systems. What You’ll Find Here This site serves as a space where I share insights, projects, and technical explorations at the intersection of: AI &amp; Machine Learning: LLM development, agent systems, fine-tuning techniques, and production deployment Software Engineering: Building scalable systems, performance optimization, and architectural decisions Aviation Technology: Flight planning software, avionics, and safety-critical systems Research: Computational methods, optimization, and translating academic research into practical applications Current Projects I’m currently working on several exciting projects: xWindAI (via Crosswind ApS) A production LLM-based agent system featuring multi-step reasoning, tool orchestration, and RLHF fine-tuning. This system demonstrates how to build autonomous decision-making capabilities for complex enterprise scenarios while maintaining accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Argos Flight Planning (via Crosswind ApS) Real-time flight planning software leveraging GPU computing for performance co-simulation. This project combines my passion for aviation with high-performance computing to create tools that help pilots make better decisions. Nexus (via Pionero ApS) An intelligent data integration platform with ML-driven insights and anomaly detection. Built to solve the real-world problem of making sense of complex data integrations across enterprise systems. Why “emacs.io”? As a long-time Emacs user and advocate for powerful, extensible tools, this domain reflects my philosophy: combine deep technical knowledge with practical, customizable solutions. Whether it’s configuring Emacs or building production ML systems, the principles remain the same—understand the fundamentals, optimize relentlessly, and never settle for “good enough.” What’s Next I’ll be sharing technical deep-dives, lessons learned from production systems, insights from working across fintech, gaming, and research, and explorations of emerging technologies in AI and aviation. Topics you can expect: LLM fine-tuning and evaluation best practices Building reliable agent systems Aviation software development and DO-178C compliance Computational methods Experimental design Production and management experiences Get in Touch I’m always interested in: Management consulting Due diligence, especially w.r.t. mergers and acquisition Mathematics Complex ML challenges that require both breadth and depth Aviation training, management and operations Aviation technology projects Consulting on AI strategy and production deployment Collaboration on research-to-production problems Horology (yes, this is extremely important in many areas of modern life) Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn." } ]
